    <h2>Guacamole</h2>
    <P>Guacamole is an avocado-based dip or spread that originated in Mexico.
        It's typically made with mashed avocado and lime juice, then seasoned with salt and cilantro.
        Guacamole often contains tomatoes and onions. </P>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 avocados - peeled, pitted, and mashed</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Â½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash avocados, lime juice, and salt together in a medium bowl.
            Mix in tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and garlic. Stir in cayenne pepper. </li>
        <li>Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for 1 hour for improved flavor. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
   <p><strong>Avocados have a tendency to turn brown when they're exposed to air, so guacamole loses its brightness rather quickly.
            You can prevent this by placing the guacamole in an airtight container, then covering the top with a thin layer of water, lemon juice, or lime juice.
            This barrier will keep the air from getting in. Seal the container and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days. </strong></p>
